## Core Idea

The simple rotating arm consists of a single beam attached to a motor or servo at a fixed pivot point. Vertical movement
results from the circular arc described by the beam's rotation.

## Advantages

* **Simplicity:** Easy and quick to build, requiring minimal materials and mechanical complexity.
* **Wide Motion Range:** Can achieve near-360-degree rotation if appropriately mounted, offering significant coverage in
  multiple directions.
* **Versatile Applications:** Ideal for simple tasks that don't require precise orientation, such as activating switches
  or scooping lightweight items.

## Disadvantages

* **Variable Lifting Force:** The force applied at the arm's end varies significantly throughout its rotational range
  due to gravity acting at different angles.
* **Lack of Orientation Control:** Unable to maintain a consistent orientation at the end effector, limiting its
  suitability for precise placement tasks.
* **Limited Payload:** Best suited for lightweight items due to the uneven torque and limited power at certain
  positions.

## Optimal Usage Scenarios

* Flicking switches, knocking objects over, or scooping lightweight items like poms.
* Tasks that do not require consistent end-effector orientation or precise control over object positioning.

## Quick Build Notes

* **High Pivot Mounting:** Mount the pivot point as high as permitted by KIPR rules to maximize the functional vertical
  range.
* **Rubber-Band Assistance:** Add rubber bands or elastic bands strategically to create a counterbalance effect,
  significantly reducing the servo load and prolonging motor life.
* **Balance:** Adjust the arm length and rubber-band tension to achieve optimal balance between speed and torque.

## Enhancements and Variations

* **Adjustable Length:** Implement telescopic or modular beams to easily adjust the arm's reach or leverage.
* **Counterweights:** Incorporate lightweight counterweights opposite the payload to balance heavier loads without
  straining the servo.
* **Multiple Arms:** Employ multiple rotating arms in parallel or sequence for coordinated tasks or increased functional
  versatility.

## Botball Applications

Frequently utilized for simple tasks like scooping poms during competitions, as seen during Botball's 2022 regional
tournaments. Proven effective for tasks where precision orientation is unnecessary, such as manipulating noodles and
other lightweight objects.
