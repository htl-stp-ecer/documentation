# IMUs in Botball

This guide will introduce the basics of using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in robotics.
You'll learn how to estimate your robot's orientation using gyroscope data and how to use this information to make your
robot rotate to a specific angle and drive straight with improved accuracy.

The methods described here are a good starting point but are not perfect. They can be improved with techniques like
sensor fusion, PID controllers, or other advanced methods. By the end of this guide, you should have a solid
understanding of how to start using an IMU in your robotics projects.

## What is an IMU?

An IMU, or Inertial Measurement Unit, is a sensor that typically includes a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and sometimes a
magnetometer.

### Key Components of an IMU

1. **Gyroscope**: Measures the rate of rotation around the x, y, and z axes. It provides data in degrees per second (
   dps) and is crucial for determining the robot's orientation.

2. **Accelerometer**: Measures the linear acceleration along the x, y, and z axes. This can help determine the robot's
   speed and tilt by detecting changes in velocity and orientation.

3. **Magnetometer**: Measures the strength and direction of the magnetic field around the sensor, often used to
   determine the robot's heading relative to the Earth's magnetic field (like a compass).

### Real-World Applications

IMUs are widely used in various technologies:

- **Smartphones**: For detecting screen orientation, motion tracking in AR/VR applications, and step counting.
- **Drones**: To stabilize flight by constantly adjusting orientation and speed.
- **Wearables**: For fitness tracking, detecting movement, and monitoring posture.

### Importance of Proper IMU Placement

To achieve accurate measurements, it's essential to mount the IMU correctly on your robot:

1. **Orientation**: The IMU should be mounted at a 90-degree angle relative to the robot's frame, with one of its axes (
   x, y, or z) pointing directly upwards.

2. **Stability**: The IMU must be securely attached to the robot to prevent any movement that could affect the sensor
   readings.

3. **Placement**: Place the IMU as close to the center of rotation of the robot to minimize the effects of the robot's
   movements on the IMU data.

## Understanding Gyroscope Data

The gyroscope in the IMU measures angular velocity, which is the rate of rotation around the three axes. This data is
usually given in degrees per second (dps). By integrating this angular velocity over time, you can estimate the robot's
orientation.

### Basic Gyro Integration

To estimate the robot's orientation, you can integrate the gyroscope data over time. The basic idea is to add the
product of the angular velocity and the time interval to the current orientation.

Here's a simple example in pseudocode:

```javascript
function estimate_orientation():
    last_time = get_current_time()  // Store the initial time
    orientation = 0  // Initialize the orientation to 0
    while True:
        gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z = read_gyroscope()  // Read gyroscope data
        current_time = get_current_time()  // Get the current time
        delta_time = current_time - last_time  // Calculate the time difference
        orientation = orientation + gyro_z * delta_time  // Update the orientation
        last_time = current_time  // Update last_time to current time
        print("Estimated orientation:", orientation)
        sleep(100) // Sleep 100ms to only integrate new gyro values
```

### Understanding Gyro Drift

Over time, small errors in the gyroscope data can accumulate, leading to inaccuracies in the estimated orientation. This
phenomenon is known as **gyro drift**. Gyro drift occurs due to factors like sensor noise, temperature changes, and
imperfect calibration. While it might not be noticeable in short operations, it can become significant over extended
periods.

Here's a guide about the two main noise types within a
gyro: [Gyro Noise Analysis](https://mwrona.com/posts/gyro-noise-analysis/)

![Gyro Drift](/img/gyro_drift.png)

*This graph shows the three estimated angles slowly drifting away when the robot doesn't move and sits on a flat
surface*

## Calibrating the Gyroscope

To improve accuracy, you need to calibrate the gyroscope to remove any bias or offset in the sensor readings.
Calibration involves taking multiple readings while the robot is stationary and calculating an average value to
determine the bias. This bias is then subtracted from the gyroscope data during operation.

Here's a basic calibration example:

```javascript
function calibrate_gyroscope():
    gyro_x_sum = 0
    gyro_y_sum = 0
    gyro_z_sum = 0
    num_samples = 100  // Number of samples for averaging
    for i in range(num_samples):
        gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z = read_gyroscope()
        gyro_x_sum += gyro_x
        gyro_y_sum += gyro_y
        gyro_z_sum += gyro_z
    gyro_x_bias = gyro_x_sum / num_samples
    gyro_y_bias = gyro_y_sum / num_samples
    gyro_z_bias = gyro_z_sum / num_samples
    print("Gyroscope biases:", gyro_x_bias, gyro_y_bias, gyro_z_bias)
```

### Using Built-In Calibration Functions

In some libraries, like the KIPR library for the Wombat robot, a calibration function might already be provided, such
as `gyro_calibrate()`. You can use this function to simplify the calibration process.

## Using the Gyroscope to Rotate Your Robot

Now that you understand how to estimate orientation using gyroscope data, you can use this knowledge to make your robot
turn by a specific angle. Here's a method for turning your robot 90 degrees:

```javascript
function turn_90_degrees():
    gyro_calibrate()  // Calibrate the gyroscope
    target_angle = 90  // Set target angle to 90 degrees
    current_angle = 0  // Initialize current angle to 0
    last_time = get_current_time()
    while current_angle < target_angle:
        gyro_z = read_gyroscope()
        current_time = get_current_time()
        delta_time = current_time - last_time
        current_angle += gyro_z * delta_time
        last_time = current_time

        if current_angle >= target_angle:
            stop_robot()
        else:
            turn_robot()
```

### Error Handling: What If the Gyroscope Fails?

During testing, you might encounter situations where the robot does not turn the expected amount, even when the code
seems correct. This could be due to faulty gyroscope data, which can occur if the gyroscope is damaged or miscalibrated.

Here's how you can handle potential errors:

```javascript
function turn_90_degrees_with_error_handling():
    gyro_calibrate()
    target_angle = 90
    current_angle = 0
    start_time = get_current_time()
    last_time = get_current_time()
    while current_angle < target_angle:
        gyro_z = read_gyroscope()
        current_time = get_current_time()
        delta_time = current_time - last_time
        current_angle += gyro_z * delta_time
        last_time = current_time

        if start_time - current_time > 5:  // Timeout after 5 seconds
            raise GyroscopeError("Gyroscope malfunction detected!")

        if current_angle >= target_angle:
            stop_robot()
        else:
            turn_robot()
```

### Compensating for Faulty Gyroscope Data

If you notice consistent errors in the robot's turns, you might need to apply a correction factor:

```javascript
corrected_target_angle = target_angle * correction_factor
```

In a real-world scenario, this factor is determined experimentally. For instance, if your robot only turns 30 degrees
when it should turn 90, you would need to multiply the target angle by 3 to achieve the correct turn.

## Improving Accuracy with PID Control

To achieve more accurate turns, you can use a PID Controller to adjust the motor speeds based on the error between the
target angle and the current angle.
To understand PID in a robotics context, check out this video:
[PID - Controlling Self Driving Cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y7zG48uHRo)

Here's a more refined example:

```javascript
function turn_robot():
    left_motor_port = 0
    right_motor_port = 1
    error = target_angle - current_angle
    kP = 1.0  // Proportional gain
    left_motor_speed = kP * error
    right_motor_speed = -kP * error
    mav(left_motor_port, left_motor_speed)
    mav(right_motor_port, right_motor_speed)
```

In this simplified example, only the proportional term (`kP`) is used, but you can expand this by adding integral (`kI`)
and derivative (`kD`) terms for better control.

## Driving Straight with the Gyroscope

The same principles used for turning can be applied to driving straight. By maintaining a constant orientation (e.g., 0
degrees), you can adjust the motor speeds to correct any deviations:

```javascript
function drive_straight():
    gyro_calibrate()
    target_angle = 0  // Set the target angle to 0 (straight)
    current_angle = 0
    last_time = get_current_time()
    while True:  // or until a certain condition is met
        gyro_z = read_gyroscope()
        current_time = get_current_time()
        delta_time = current_time - last_time
        current_angle += gyro_z * delta_time
        last_time = current_time
        error = target_angle - current_angle
        adjust_speed(error)

function adjust_speed(error):
    base_speed = 50
    left_motor_port = 0
    right_motor_port = 1
    kP = 1.0  // Proportional gain for correction
    left_motor_speed = base_speed + kP * error
    right_motor_speed = base_speed - kP * error
    mav(left_motor_port, left_motor_speed)
    mav(right_motor_port, right_motor_speed)
```

![Bang Bang Control Driving Straight](/img/bang-bang-control-driving-straight.gif)

*In the GIF, one can see how this implementation would be driving straight.
One can also see the issues the basic error correction (Bang-Bang Control) has*

Again, this method is a basic implementation and might not work perfectly over long distances due to gyro drift.

## Further Enhancements

While the methods discussed are a good starting point, they can be enhanced in several ways:

- **Sensor Fusion**: Combine gyroscope data with accelerometer and magnetometer data to reduce drift using algorithms
  like the Complementary Filter, Madgwick Filter or a Kalman Filter.
- **PID Controller**: Use a PID controller to fine-tune motor speeds and improve accuracy in both turning and straight
  driving.
- **Adaptive Calibration**: Continuously recalibrate the gyroscope to account for changes in environmental conditions
  that could affect sensor accuracy.
- **Landmark-based Error Correction**: Use known environmental features, like lines on the floor or walls, to correct
  orientation drift.
- **Dead Reckoning with Error Estimation**: Combine gyroscope data with other sensors like Back-EMF to cross-check
  and reduce drift.

## Troubleshooting

One issue encountered when programming the gyroscope on the Wombat was that the data only updated each second.
This problem can be fixed by using v30 or later for the Wombat image.

When updating, make sure to flash the STM32 board with the firmware provided by KIPR.
This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
cd ~/flashfiles && sudo bash ./wallaby_flash
```

> The exact command might differ for you, as KIPR regularly updates their image, which might cause the location of this
> script to change. Best would be to contact Tim about flashing the STM32 board if you can't find the script.

After flashing and a restart, the gyroscope and the other IMU sensors will now update their values much more
frequently, making them usable.

## Conclusion

Using the IMU can significantly improve your robot's ability to rotate and drive straight.
However, you must understand the limitations of the gyroscope, particularly drift, and explore ways to mitigate it.

If you encounter issues with inaccurate turns, consider experimenting with correction factors as described in this
guide. By starting with the basic methods provided here and then exploring more advanced techniques, you can develop a
highly accurate system for controlling your robot's movements.

While the IMU is a powerful tool, it should not be relied upon exclusively. Combining it with other
methods, such as driving against PVC pipes or aligning with black lines, achieves the best accuracy.
